# Welcome to My Portfolio

I'm a recent graduate student from UC Berkeley. I've been tutoring for over 2 years and look forward to obtaining a MS in Data Science or Statistics so that I can utilize Data Visualization to inspire Audiences. My interest includes Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Linear Algebra. In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball, reading and traveling. 

Recent projects are included in this repository. This included independent and coursework projects. Enjoy! ;)
