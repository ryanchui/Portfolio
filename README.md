# Welcome to My Portfolio

I'm a recent graduate student from University of California, Berkeley. I've been tutoring students in Mathematics and Statistics and look forward to obtaining a MS in Data Science or Statistics so that I can utilize Data Visualization to inspire Audiences. As the world moves into "Big Data", technology, finance, and manufacturing organizations, and even the government will require skilled Statisticians and Data Analyst to analyze this huge amount of data and trends, therefore my interest to pursue a career in Data Scientist is timely since the "Big Data" phenomena is just the beginning. I am inspired by companies that use data to inform product decisions that positively affect user experience. My interests include Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Linear Algebra. In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball, reading and traveling. 

Recent projects are included in this repository. This included independent and coursework projects. Enjoy! ;)
