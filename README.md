# Welcome to My Portfolio

I am a recent graduate student from University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), and I'm experienced in Python, R and Matlab. I have tutored students in Mathematics and Statistics in different background and look forward to obtaining a MS degree in Data Science or Statistics, so that I can utilize Data Visualization to inspire Audiences. As the world moves into "Big Data", technology, finance, and manufacturing organizations as well as the government will require skilled Statisticians and Data Analyst to identify this huge amount of data and trends. Therefore, my interest to pursue a career in Data Scientist is timely since the "Big Data" phenomena is just the beginning. I am inspired by companies that use data to inform product decisions that positively affect user experience. My interests include Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Time Series Forecasting. In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball, reading and traveling. 

Recent projects are included in this repository. This included independent and coursework projects. Please enjoy and feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn @http://linkedin.com/in/ryanchui15/. Thank you!
