# Welcome to My Portfolio

My name is Ryan Chui. I am a recent graduate student from University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) in Spring 2017. I have tutored students in Mathematics and Statistics in different background and look forward to obtaining a MS degree in Data Science or Statistics, so that I can utilize Data Visualization to inspire Audiences. As the world moves into "Big Data", technology, finance, and manufacturing organizations as well as the government will require skilled Statisticians and Data Analysts to identify this huge amount of data and trends. Therefore, my interest to pursue a career in Data Scientist is timely since the "Big Data" phenomena is just the beginning. I am inspired by companies that use data to inform product decisions that positively affect user experience. My interests include Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Time Series Forecasting. In the future, I'm eager to learn MapReduce, Spark, Hadoop, Tableau and Hive, HDFS, Spark and Cybersecurity. In my free time, I enjoy reading and playing volleyball.

On April 15, 2017, I have attended Berkeley Data Science Forum hosted by Data Science Society at Berkeley. Thankful for DSSB, I have learned much more about the career growth in Data Science field and explore some the challenges of the industries are facing academically and professionally, ranging of companies from Google, Airbnb, SalesForce, Microsoft, LinkedIn and Quora etc. ![17991854_10212504494145660_4694672017223209842_n](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8663154/25114763/eee48094-23b5-11e7-944c-a0dedd17721d.jpg)
