    "\n",
    "Today's lab will review the idea of hypothesis testing using random permutations. This technique is described in the [Permutation chapter of the textbook](http://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapter5/permutation.html) and is used often in practice.\n",

    "Many studies generate a table that describes multiple attributes for each element in a sample of a population. One important step in studying some aspect of the world via such a sample is to identify associations. An association between a *treatment* attribute and an *outcome* attribute in a population is any relation between them: the outcome varies in some way with the treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a random sample, the outcome may appear associated with the treatment because there is in fact an association in the population, or simply because the sample happened to come out that way. The purpose of statistical hypothesis testing is to account quantitatively for the possibility that two attributes may appear related in a sample even though they are not related in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will review the *permutation test* techique from lecture and further investigate the dataset of married couples and unmarried partners to identify associations. The data are based on a study conducted in 2010 under the auspices of the National Center for Family and Marriage Research. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rows describe individual people who all participate in a two-person heterosexual relationship. The columns describe:\n",
    "- **ID**: An identifier for each couple\n",
    "- **Gender**: The self-reported sex of each individual\n",
    "- **Marital Status**: Whether the person is married to the individual with the same ID\n",
    "- **Relationship Rating**: How satisfied is the person with her/his relationship? 1 is most satisfied; 5 is least satisfied\n",
    "- **Age**: Age in years\n",
    "- **Education**: Self-reported highest level of education achieved\n",
