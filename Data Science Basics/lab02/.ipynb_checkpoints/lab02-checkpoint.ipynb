    "The two building blocks of Python code are *expressions* and *statements*.  An expression is a piece of code that is self-contained and (usually) *has a value*.  Here are some expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    3\n",
    "    2 - 3\n",

    "    max(3, pow(2, abs(2 - 3) + pow(2, 2)))\n",

    "All these expressions but the first are *compound expressions*, meaning that they are themselves combinations of several smaller expressions.  `2 + 3` combines the expressions `2` and `3` by addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *statement* is a whole line of code.  Some statements are just expressions.  Others *make something happen* rather than *having a value*.  After they are run, something in the world has changed.  For example, an assignment statement assigns a value to a value.  Here are some statements:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    height = 1.3\n",

    "A key idea in programming is that large, interesting things can be built by combining many simple, uninteresting things.  The key to understanding a complicated piece of code is breaking it down into its simple components.\n",
