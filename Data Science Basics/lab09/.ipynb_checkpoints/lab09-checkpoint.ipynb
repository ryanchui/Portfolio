    "# 1. Predicting House Prices\n",
    "For many people, their house is their most valuable asset, so selling a house is an important event.  When deciding on a price to sell at, an owner wants to ask for the highest price at which she can sell the house in a reasonable amount of time.  Owners often ask real-estate agents to set the price, and these agents use their knowledge of the house and the local housing market to guess at the right price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see if we can do that with a computer instead, by mimicking prices other owners set for *similar* houses.  Since we're predicting a price, which is a number, this is a *regression* task.  And we want to use multiple pieces of information about a house to predict its price, so it's a *multiple* regression task.  Since we've learned about linear regression in this class, we'll do multiple *linear* regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The table `house_prices.csv` contains the listed prices of 566 houses sold in Southern California in 2009.    For each house, it also records several of the house's attributes:\n",
    "* how big it is (in square feet),\n",
    "* the number of bedrooms and bathrooms it has, and\n",
    "* the house's location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The locations are represented in a peculiar way that helps us use them in linear regression: There is a column for each potential location, and each house has a 1 in the column for its location and a 0 for the other location columns.  That's a common trick; some people call these kinds of columns \"dummy variables\".\n",
